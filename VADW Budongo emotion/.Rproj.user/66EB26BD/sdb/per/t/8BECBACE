(column L), if column L = x, then aggression  = Y\n## record total time and total time split into give/recieve/mutual - for aggression and for allogrooming \n#* If yes does focal reconcile after aggression? (columns BH-BV)\n#* If yes record details of reconciliation (BH-BV)\n#* If column F-N is empty for any row, then column R should be complete\n\n# Columns O-Q: proximity/social data\n## Record total time spent with others during focal (column O)\n# Length of time for who they are with the most, dyadically (ie conspecific spent most time with) \n\t# refers to col O\n\t# do not take into acocunt grooming\n## Record total time spent allogrooming others during focal (column P)\n## divide this into give, recieve, mutual (column I 'AG')\n# ID of main neighbour, dyadically (ie conspecific spent near to for longest)\n\t# individual spent msot time near - see col O\n\t# each combo is a distinct option\n## Record total time spent near others during focal (column Q)\n# ID of main conspecific groomed with, dyadically (ie conspecific spent most time with)\n\t# same thing again for grooming partner\n\n# Event and response to event: column R onwards\n## Record total number of events per focal: column R\n# Compile individual data per event: \n# If column R is complete, record pod, time, name of conspecific per event (columns D, E and S), state behaviour that occurs before each event (columns F-N), amd if they are with, grooming with or near anyone prior to event (columns O-Q), and if yes, record ID if dyadic; retain info for column R\n# NB for state behaviour and social data, these will be on the row immediately before the event\n# If column R (Emotion happens) is complete, is column T = Yes?\n## If column T = Yes, add data from columns R-AM\n# If column T = Yes, is AN-AQ complete (any of these)?
