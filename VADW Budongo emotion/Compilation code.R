######## CODE REQUIRED FOR CHIMP BEHAVIOURAL DATA COMPILATION: 16.04.15

# example: Week 4, 17.02.14, 6 focals split into separate csv files
## Columns A-C: retain chimp, day, start time
## Column D: time coded on a continuous basis, so time only changes when behavioural state changes or event occurs; time for each behaviour event should be 
## row x - row (x-1)
## End time is always 30.00 (minutes) unless stated in last row


# Columns F-N: state behaviours - only ever 1 behaviour in any row
## Record state behaviour with longest time during focal/or just record total # time for each behaviour - minutes and seconds
## column specifying length of focal - should be 30 minutes unless it says otherwise in last row
## Record location where longest time is spent/or total time spent in each location
## Whether focal is out of sight during focal (column M), i.e. if column = x
## If yes, how long OS for (total)?
## Does focal give or recieve aggression during focal? (column L), if column L = x, then aggression  = Y
## record total time and total time split into give/recieve/mutual - for aggression and for allogrooming 
# If yes does focal reconcile after aggression? (columns BH-BV)
# If yes record details of reconciliation (BH-BV)
# If column F-N is empty for any row, then column R should be complete

# Columns O-Q: proximity/social data
# Record total time spent with others during focal (column O)
# Length of time for who they are with the most, dyadically (ie conspecific spent most time with)
# Record total time spent allogrooming others during focal (column P)
#  divide this into give, recieve, mutual (column I 'AG')
# ID of main neighbour, dyadically (ie conspecific spent near to for longest)
# Record total time spent near others during focal (column Q)
# ID of main conspecific groomed with, dyadically (ie conspecific spent most time with)

# Event and response to event: column R onwards
# Record total number of events per focal: column R
# Compile individual data per event: 
# If column R is complete, record pod, time, name of conspecific per event (columns D, E and S), state behaviour that occurs before each event (columns F-N), amd if they are with, grooming with or near anyone prior to event (columns O-Q), and if yes, record ID if dyadic; retain info for column R
# NB for state behaviour and social data, these will be on the row immediately before the event
# If column R is complete, is column T = Yes?
# If column T = Yes, add data from columns R-AM
# If column T = Yes, is AN-AQ complete (any of these)?
# If AN-AQ contain any data, add data from columns AR-BG
# If column T = Yes, is BH-BV complete (any of these)?
# If yes, add data for colums BH-BV
