#H1. # We predict that, if previous responses to the outcomes were based only on the emotional valence of the footage, 
# and not on the continuity of the footage with the prior scenario, then for the current experiment, 
# differences in looking time between the emotional and non-emotional victim outcomes should be consistent with what we found previously.

# H2. # We predict that, if the chimpanzeesâ€™ response to the outcomes is based only on the emotional valence of the footage, 
# and is not influenced by prior footage, then differences in both looking time and temperature changes between
# the outcomes should be matched between seeing them with no prior footage, and seeing them with prior, unrelated footage.

### 3. for new data, compare LT between outcomes to examine diffs in response to victim vs. novel
# 2 models (emotional & unemotional) for horses scenario Carlos outcomes (using raw data, outcomes all the same length) including novel scenes

### 4. for new data, compare LT between outcomes to examine diffs in response to masked vs. unmasked scenes
# 1 model for horses scenario Eric outcomes (using prop. data, unemotional outcome differs in length) including novel scenes
# 1 model for no scenario Eric outcomes (using prop. data, unemotional outcome differs in length) including novel scenes

coefs

# compare emotional masked scenes to unmasked emotional scenes for horses only
mm7 <- lmer(log(LT.Outcome) ~ Outcome + (1|Chimp), data = eric[eric$Horses == "Y",])
# LT for bystander masked signif lower than emotional scene

# compare emotional masked scenes to unmasked emotional scenes for no horses 
mm8 <- lmer(log(LT.Outcome) ~ Outcome + (1|Chimp), data = eric[eric$Horses == "N",])
# LT for bystander masked signif higher than emotional scene

# compare emotional scenes to unemotional scene for horses only
mm9 <- lmer(log(LT.Outcome) ~ Outcome + (1|Chimp), data = eric2[eric$Horses == "Y",])

# compare emotional scenes to unemotional scene for horses only
mm10 <- lmer(log(LT.Outcome) ~ Outcome + (1|Chimp), data = eric2[eric$Horses == "N",])
# LT for masked scenes signif higher than umemot outcome 

### 5. For individuals that saw chimp conflict scenes on both occasions (old and new) compare raw LT between outcomes
# long format
# paired t test, 1 for each outcome
# raw LT ~ year[column which specifices when each scene was viewed, ie with 1 or 2]
