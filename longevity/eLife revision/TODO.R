### TODO

1. change import process so that it takes the raw spreadsheet and that's basically all '
- datX should be able to provide this
2. Make the GAM regressions and add their residuals to the data frame
3. Revise and run the models 



X. what added bits of stuff are needed?
e.g. an analysis of the mother vs nursery reared chimps?
